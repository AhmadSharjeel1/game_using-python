This code implements a simple command-line version of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. Let's break down each part:

print_board(board): This function takes a 3x3 board represented as a list of lists and prints it to the console with appropriate formatting.

check_winner(board, player): This function checks if a given player has won the game on the provided board. It checks for winning conditions in rows, columns, and diagonals.

is_board_full(board): This function checks if the board is full, meaning there are no empty cells left.

main(): This is the main function where the game logic is implemented. It initializes an empty 3x3 board and starts a loop for players to make moves. Players input their moves by specifying the row and column numbers. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.

Inside the loop, the board is printed, and then the current player is prompted to enter their move. The code checks if the selected cell is empty, if not, it prompts the player to try again.

After each move, the code checks if the current player has won or if the board is full. If either condition is true, the game ends, and the result is printed.

Finally, the main() function is called if the script is executed directly.

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the command-line interface.
